This is a draft of the boilerplate we'll use for a react subapp.
Don't forget to change "modulename" with your module name on lines 2-4-13 in the package.json file.

The following files are there as examples, you have to change them with your own :
  **/index.js files should be adapted for your file structure

  ./src/Components/**
  ./src/GraphQL/**
  ./index.js
