## Welcome to the Strategizer\n\n
The Strategizer is an interface that enables you to create complex trading strategies by using conditional statements resulting in the power of automated algorithmic trading at your fingertips!\n
\n
**The Strategizer:**
- connects indicators to a simulator called the Trading Intelligence Engine\n
- allows you to use the data of multiple indicators to react to the varying conditions in the market\n
- utilizes conditions that control both general strategy activation and fine-tuned trade events\n
\n
### About the default strategy\n
Currently, the forked algobots work in the BTC/USDT market. The default strategy fed into the simulation engine creates a strategic indicator dataset shared with the trading algobot with the purpose to _accumulate_ Bitcoin. To clarify, this means that the default strategies are working to obtain more Bitcoin rather than USDT, and so the conditions within will generally be the inverse of a strategy working to obtain more USDT.\n
