## Welcome to the Strategizer\n\n
The Strategizer enables you to create complex trading strategies by using conditional statements. The power of algorithmic trading at your fingertips â€” minimal coding required!\n
\n
**The Strategizer:**
- connects to a special type of indicator algobot called a simulator\n
- allows you to use the data of multiple indicator algobots to react to the varying conditions in the market\n
- build conditions that control both general strategy activation and fine-tuned trade events\n
\n
### About the default strategy\n
Currently, the forked algobots work in the BTC/USDT market. The simulator algobot that provides the strategic indicator dataset to the trading algobot is set with the purpose to _accumulate_ Bitcoin. To clarify, this means that the default strategies are working to obtain more Bitcoin rather than USDT, and so the conditions within will generally be the inverse of a strategy working to obtain more USDT.\n
