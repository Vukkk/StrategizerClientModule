## Welcome to the Strategizer\n\n
The Strategizer enables interacting with algobots through the use of conditional statements.

The Strategizer connects to a special type of indicator algobot called a simulator. The simulator uses the conditions you make to interact with a variety of other indicator bots used to define "strategy events" that tell a trading algot bot how to act given a specified situation.
